        An exciting curriculum in the after school classes allows children the
        opportunity to acquire Italian linguistic competence and most
        importantly, a deep appreciation of Italian and European culture. The
        children will be able to explore and experiment through various
        workshops and academic grammar programs while learning together and
        speaking to each other in Italian.

        <span className="font-bold">Art:</span>
        <br /> An engaging way to explore and have fun together while learning
        Italian is through art. We will work on projects that reinforce the
        learning experience and give the children a chance to explore and
        experiment with different materials while still acquiring Italian.
