        All of our programs are based on learning through play in a fun, safe
        and stimulating environment. Italian cultural themes are explored
        through games, music, art, drama, books and cooking. By utilizing
        language learning activities and materials, academic instruction is
        achieved in a context that values a childâ€™s natural playful tendencies
        and curiosities. This process is reinforced by carefully developed
        curriculums taught entirely by native speakers.
