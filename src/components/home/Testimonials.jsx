            “My two daughters, now ages 16 and 13, have been going to Spazio
            Italiano since they were toddlers. There, they grew up immersed in
            Italian songs, stories, food and friendship. Through this immersive
            experience when they weee young they learned the Italian language
            through play and later through structured grammar classes. As they
            have grown older Spazio Italiano has become their second home.
            Ilaria Giannini is truly a gift to our family and our community.”

            “I have been taking my son Arlo to Spazio since he was 9 months old,
            he is now 5 and it’s one of his favorite places to be! It is such a
            special environment for us. It’s amazing to watch his Italian
            improve. Ilaria is so wonderful with all the children, she is quick
            to think and act and handle any situation that may arise. All the
            kids are drawn to her warm and loving nature.”

            “My almost 3 year old son has thoroughly enjoyed Ilaria's group
            classes. She is an engaging and fun teacher who exposes the kids to
            one of the world's most beautiful languages through songs, books,
            and play. My son looks forward to seeing her every week, and I've
            already signed him up for the fall!.”

            “If you wish your children to learn Italian in a warm, caring
            environment, Spazio Italiano is the perfect place. Maestra Ilaria, a
            native of Rome, is not only knowledgeable of the language but is
            also versed in teaching techniques for children of different ages.
            Every morning my grandchildren attend Spazio, they are excited and
            eager to go. Grazie, Maestra Ilaria!”
